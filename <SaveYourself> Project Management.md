__Vision__
------
The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a mobile game that encourages one-on-one social interaction between its players.


__Configuration Plan__
------------------
The project will be developed using the Unity Game Engine. We will be using GitHub for both the required documentation as well as version control for this project. Other tools such as Google Docs may be used to allow for group collaboration, but as instructed by this course's instructor, GitHub will be our primary tool.


__Process Model__
-----------------
Agile Method.


__Deliverables__
----------------
The deliverables will be available to the instructor and grader via the GitHub repository as specified by the instructor.


__Potential Risks__
-------------------
The possible risks that pose a problem during the development of this project are as follows:
* Time constraints brought upon by factors such as school, work, and family commitments.
* Other risks...


__Team Members__
----------------
Our project development team consists of the following members:
* Tyler Baronet
* Joshua Do
* Kalyn Odom
* Kristofer Oubre
* Melva Matthews
* Jody Toms

Each group member's tasks are to-be-determined as soon as Midterms are finished and time can more effectively be allocated for them. The team style also is yet to be determined.


__Project Schedule__
--------------------
Our project schedule also falls in line with our group tasks, as this is also to-be-determined after Midterms.


__Meetings Summary__
--------------------
To be added at a later time.
