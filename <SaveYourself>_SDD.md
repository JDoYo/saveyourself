# 1. Introduction

1.1 Purpose
    
    This Software Design Document is designed and intended to detail the implementation of the requirments  as defined in the Software Requirments Specification for the Save Yourself mobile game. The document is intended to fully explore the user experience as well as explore features for full utilization of the application.

1.2 Intended Audience
    
    This software design document is specifically intended for those who are stakeholders for the mobile game application, Save Yourself. **need to add more here about what stakeholders should go to what section?**

1.3 Scope

    The scope of the SDD was creatd to give the people who are working closely with the application to get an in-depth idea of the concept. Everything the conceptual architecture, to the design views, to the database design will be contained within this document. The application is intended for users who want to have an enjoyable mobile game experience without any problem. 

1.4 Design Summary

    At its core, Save Yourself is a simple and addicting mobile game that will give users an escape from their lives. We want users to feel like the game isn't going to cheat them with overly expensive in-game purchases that don't do a lot for you. With a simple concept of tapping a screen you're able to enjoy a fun and custom experience. Time permitting, we intend to make different senarios to fight different types of foes. Also in the backlog is the multiplayer feature which would let you and a friend join together to defeat enimemies, or play against them. We intend to make this a rather simple concept idea at first and then from there this idea can be fully fleshed out adding more subsystems, time permitting. Unity will be our primary building tool, allowing us to control everything to our exact design specifications.

# 2. Design Considerations

2.1 Assumptions
   
   We, the designers, assume that all users are in possetion of either and iPhone or Android device which has been updated to iOS8 or (Android version numbers go here idk them rn). Without that, many of our application features would not be possible or the phone will be too outdated to it.

2.2 Constraints

    The application will be contrained to only users who have an iPhone or Android.

2.3 System Environment

    The application will reside within the user's mobile device. Both iPhone and Android devices will store the various statistics that are accumulated from the game into a simple database. Unity will take care of a lot of the porting to each of the devices. While we're not sure what kind of database we're using, we will most likely be using a SQL database.

2.4 Risks and Volatile Areas

    There could be possible secruity risks using this software. Any undocumented OS risks could potentially cause a data leak or a memory leak. If implemented, the multiplayer aspect of the game could be a risk of a potential risk from a third party.

# 3. Conceptual System Architecture

3.1 Overview

Save Yourself is a mobile game with a concept and playstyle that is easy for the user to learn and partake in. The mobile game is a tap-survival game similar to others available on various mobile application stores, but offers new features to encourage one-on-one social interaction with its users. The mobile game will have a homescreen that allows the user to select from several playstyles. The user can choose to play the game by themselves by selecting the Single-Player option on the homescreen. The user can also play the game with others (maximum of four players at once) by selecting the Multi-Player option on the homescreen. The basics of how to play the game as well as how to take advantage of its features will be outlined on a page accessible by selecting the Help option on the homescreen.

3.2 Playstyle

The user's character will be represented by an avatar located in the center of the screen. Surrounding the user's avatar will be various enemy avatars generated by the mobile-game that will make their way towards the user's avatar. The user must tap the screen corresponding to the location of the enemy avatar in order to destroy them. If an enemy avatar makes contact with the user's avatar, damage will be dealt to the user's avatar. Once a certain amount of damage is dealt to the user's avatar, the round ends and the user's total score is displayed on screen. The user will then be displayed the option of restarting the round, or exiting to the mobile game's homescreen.

3.3 Single-Player

The user can play alone by selecting the Single-Player option available on the mobile game's homescreen. This option will allow to user to play by themselves against the mobile-game's AI. The user can then play a round of the game as outlined in 3.2.

3.4 Multi-Player

The user can choose to play with other by selecting the Multi-Player option available to them on the mobile game's homescreen. This option will allow the user to play with others against the mobile game's AI. Once this option is selected, the user is presented with a screen that will allow them to select the number of players that will be participating. With Save Yourself's initial release, the maximum number of players allowed with this feature will be four. The user as Player 1 then plays a round of the game as outlined in 3.2. Once Player One's round has ended and the score has been displayed, their score is then saved to be used later. Control of the game then moves over to Player Two, which repeats the same process as with Player One. This process also repeats for Players Three and Four depending on the user's player count selected at the beginning of the match. Once each player has played one round, each of the player's scores are displayed on screen from highest to lowest. The players will then be presented the option of restarting the match, or exiting to the mobile game's homescreen.
>Note: The description above will make up the Multi-Player feature of Save Yourself's initial release. In the future, it is possible that Save Yourself will take advantage of WiFi or Bluetooth connectivity to link multiple devices together. With this version of Multi-Player, each player can play a match against each other simultaneously by allowing one player to launch enemy avatar's at the other player while trying to defend themselves from the other.

3.5 Help

The user can choose to view the help screen by selecting the Help option available to them on the mobile game's homescreen. This screen will display the directions on how to properly play the game, as outlined in 3.2. Also, the screen will provide information to the user on how to use the Multi-Player feature of the mobile game.
