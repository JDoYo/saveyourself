# 1. Introduction

1.1 Purpose
    
    This Software Design Document is designed and intended to detail the implementation of the requirments  as defined in the Software Requirments Specification for the Save Yourself mobile game. The document is intended to fully explore the user experience as well as explore features for full utilization of the application.

1.2 Intended Audience
    
    This software design document is specifically intended for those who are stakeholders for the mobile game application, Save Yourself. **need to add more here about what stakeholders should go to what section?**

1.3 Scope

    The scope of the SDD was creatd to give the people who are working closely with the application to get an in-depth idea of the concept. Everything the conceptual architecture, to the design views, to the database design will be contained within this document. The application is intended for users who want to have an enjoyable mobile game experience without any problem. 

1.4 Design Summary

    At its core, Save Yourself is a simple and addicting mobile game that will give users an escape from their lives. We want users to feel like the game isn't going to cheat them with overly expensive in-game purchases that don't do a lot for you. With a simple concept of tapping a screen you're able to enjoy a fun and custom experience. Time permitting, we intend to make different senarios to fight different types of foes. Also in the backlog is the multiplayer feature which would let you and a friend join together to defeat enimemies, or play against them. We intend to make this a rather simple concept idea at first and then from there this idea can be fully fleshed out adding more subsystems, time permitting. Unity will be our primary building tool, allowing us to control everything to our exact design specifications.

# 2. Design Considerations

2.1 Assumptions
   
   We, the designers, assume that all users are in possetion of either and iPhone or Android device which has been updated to iOS8 or (Android version numbers go here idk them rn). Without that, many of our application features would not be possible or the phone will be too outdated to it.

2.2 Constraints

    The application will be contrained to only users who have an iPhone or Android.

2.3 System Environment

    The application will reside within the user's mobile device. Both iPhone and Android devices will store the various statistics that are accumulated from the game into a simple database. Unity will take care of a lot of the porting to each of the devices. While we're not sure what kind of database we're using, we will most likely be using a SQL database.

2.4 Risks and Volatile Areas

    There could be possible secruity risks using this software. Any undocumented OS risks could potentially cause a data leak or a memory leak. If implemented, the multiplayer aspect of the game could be a risk of a potential risk from a third party.
