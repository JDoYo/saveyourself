__1.) Vision__
------
The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a mobile game that encourages one-on-one social interaction between its players.


__2.) Configuration Plan__
------------------
The project was developed using the Unity Game Engine. GitHub was used for both the required documentation as well as version control for this project. Google Drive was used to allow for group collaboration on such things as the final presentation, while GroupMe and email were used for group communication outside of our meetings.


__3.) Process Model__
-----------------
During the development of this project, we used the Agile Method. This allowed us to make changes to the central theme of our application as needed during its development. It also allowed us to divide up the work based on each team member's strengths. Due to the documentation expectations, each member had to contribute in some form on each document.

__4.) Deliverables__
----------------
All current documentation and C# code from Unity are available for the course's instructor and grader via the GitHub repository, as specified by the course's instructor.


__5.) Potential Risks__
-------------------
The possible risks that pose a problem during the development of this project are as follows:
* Time constraints brought upon by factors such as school, work, and personal commitments.
* Possible incompatiblility of the mobile application with one of our devices (for testing purposes).
