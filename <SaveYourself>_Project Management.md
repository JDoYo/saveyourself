__1.) Vision__
------
The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a mobile game that encourages one-on-one social interaction between its players.


__2.) Configuration Plan__
------------------
The project was developed using the Unity Game Engine. GitHub was used for both the required documentation as well as version control for this project. Other tools such as Google Drive were used to allow for group collaboration on such things as the final presentation, but as instructed by this course's instructor, GitHub was our primary tool.


__3.) Process Model__
-----------------
Agile Method.


__4.) Deliverables__
----------------
All current deliverables are available to the instructor and grader via the GitHub repository as specified by the course's instructor.


__5.) Potential Risks__
-------------------
The possible risks that pose a problem during the development of this project are as follows:
* Time constraints brought upon by factors such as school, work, and family commitments.
* Possible incompatiblility of the mobile application with one of our devices (for testing purposes).


__6.) Project Personnel__

* Tyler Baronet
